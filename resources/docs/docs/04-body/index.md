# Body
The body is the mid-section of the report that houses the main content of the report. It is the section that is most likely to be the largest section of the report. It is also the section that is most likely to be the most customized section of the report.

:::info
More configurations will be added for the header sections, and hence the seggregation or compartmentalization of the header into a separate section. This will allow for more flexibility in the future to add things such as background images, etc.
:::

## Components
In the header, you can place the following components:
- [Text](/docs/components/text)
- [Image](/docs/components/image)
- [Vertical Space](/docs/components/vertical-space)
- [Table](/docs/body/table)

Or use the following layouts to arrange the components:
- [Body Row](/docs/body/body-row)
- [Body Column](/docs/body/body-column)

:::tip
If you want to ignore the body on a specific page, you can remove this method altogether, or you can leave it as is when created, where it has an empty schema.
