## What is Filament Reports?

🔥 Filament reports will **help you build** elegant reports in no time.

💥 Building reports is a time consuming, where we either build tables and call them 
reports, or we take days or weeks building reports with elegant UI.

❤️ Filament reports will help you build elegant reports in no time. Build elegant reports
the same way you build your filament tables and form.

### To summarise
👉🏽 Filament reports is a filament plugin that will help you build elegant reports in no time. It comes
packaged with various commands, components, and layouts to help you build comprehensive reports. This package
will ensure that you only focus on building your reports, and not worry about the CSS and HTML 
behind it all.

:::note
This package is exclusively for [Filament](https://filamentadmin.com) admin panel. It will not work 
outside of filament. For use outside filament, the package is not yet designed to work with other
environments. Though I am working hard to make that a possibility.

  - You can have multiple tables in your report, for example like in a balance sheet where you may have a table for assets, and another for liabilities.

    - You can customise the report to your liking, from the layout, to the table, to the table columns, to the table rows, to the table cells, to the table cell values.

I also didn't forget to include filters.
