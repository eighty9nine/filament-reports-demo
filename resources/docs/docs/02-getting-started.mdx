# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Filament reports is designed to be a simple, yet powerful reporting tool for your Filament application. So to begin with, you'll need to have a Filament application installed and running.

| Requirement | Version |
| ----------- |---------|
| PHP | ^8.1    |
| Laravel | ^10.0   |
| Filament | ^3.0    |

## Installation
After you become a sponsor, you can install the package directly from GitHub.
:::info
This package is currently available for sponsors only, and when I reach 50 sponsors, it will be available for everyone. If you are interested in using this package, please consider sponsoring me on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/eighty9nine).
:::


### Add Repository

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="project-url" label="Using Project URL" default>
    Add the repository to your composer.json file. Using the project URL will require authentication when you require the package.
    ```json title="composer.json"

    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/eighty9nine/filament-reports.git"
        }
    ]
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssh-key" label="Using SSH Key">
    Add the repository to your composer.json file:
    ```json title="composer.json"

    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:eighty9nine/filament-reports.git"
        }
    ]
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Require Package
Then require the package using composer:
```bash
composer require eighty9nine/filament-reports
```

### Publish Assets
Publish the assets to your application:
```bash
php artisan filament:assets
```

### Publish Config
Publish the config file to your application:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-reports-config
```

## Usage

### Include the plugin
Just like other filament plugins, first you have to link the plugin to your application. You can do this by adding the package to you plugin provider.

```php title="app\Providers\Filament\AdminPanelProvider.php" showLineNumbers
use EightyNine\Reports\ReportsPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->default()
        ->id('admin')
        ->path('admin')
        //...
        ->plugins([
            ReportsPlugin::make()
        ]);
}
```
### Create your first report
To create your first report, the plugin includes a command to generate a report class for you. You can run the command using the following artisan command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-report MyFirstReport
```

This will create a new report class in the `app/Filament/Reports` directory. The class will look like this:

```php title="app/Filament/Reports/MyFirstReport.php" showLineNumbers
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Reports;

use EightyNine\Reports\Report;
use EightyNine\Reports\Components\Body;
use EightyNine\Reports\Components\Footer;
use EightyNine\Reports\Components\Header;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

class MyFirstReport extends Report
{
    public ?string $heading = "Report";

    // public ?string $subHeading = "A great report";

    public function header(Header $header): Header
    {
        return $header
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]);
    }


    public function body(Body $body): Body
    {
        return $body
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]);
    }

    public function footer(Footer $footer): Footer
    {
        return $footer
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]);
    }

    public function filterForm(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```
### Report structure
The report has the following sections:
- [Header](/docs/header)
- [Body](/docs/body)
- [Footer](/docs/footer)
- [Filter Form](/docs/filters)

<img src="/img/annotated-report.png" alt="alt text" width="100%"/>

### Header
The header is the top section of the report, it can be used to display a title, subtitle, image and a description. If
the section is left empty, nothing will be displayed, but if you have a custom header for your report, this is where you
can define it.

The header area has layouts that can be used to arrange items. The layouts are `HeaderColumn` and `HeaderRow`.

- `HeaderColumn` is a vertical layout, it will stack the items on top of each other. Items inside the `HeaderColumn` can
aligned vertically and horizontally, depending on how you wish to align the items.
- `HeaderRow` is a horizontal layout, it will place the items next to each other. Items inside the `HeaderRow` can be aligned
vertically and horizontally, depending on how you wish to align the items.

The `HeaderColumn` and `HeaderRow` can be nested inside each other to create more complex layouts.

Apart from the Layouts, the header also has components that can be used to display data. The components are:
- `Text` - This is used to display text, it can be used to display a title or a subtitle, or with any styling you may prefer.
- `Image` - This is used to display an image, it can be used to display a logo or any other image you may want to display.

Here is an example of the header section:
```php showLineNumbers

    public function header(Header $header): Header
    {
        return $header
            ->schema([
                Header\Layout\HeaderRow::make()
                ->schema([
                    Header\Layout\HeaderColumn::make()
                        ->schema([
                            Text::make("User registration report")
                                ->title()
                                ->primary(),
                            Text::make("A user registration report")
                                ->subtitle(),
                        ]),
                    Header\Layout\HeaderColumn::make()
                        ->schema([
                            Image::make($imagePath),
                        ])
                        ->alignRight(),
                ]),
            ]);
    }

````

### Body
The body is the main section of the report, it can be used to display a table, chart or any other data. If the section
is left empty, nothing will be displayed.

The body area has layouts that can be used to arrange items. The layouts are `BodyColumn` and `BodyRow`.
These behave the same as the `HeaderColumn` and `HeaderRow` but are used for the body section. But they are used specifically
for the body section, because they have different styling.

Apart from the Layouts, the body also has components that can be used to display data. The components are:
- `Table` - This is used to display a table, it can be used to display a list of data.
- `VerticalSpace` - This is used to add vertical spacing between items.

The `Text` and `Image` components can also be used in the body section.

Here is an example of the body section:
```php showLineNumbers

    public function body(Body $body): Body
    {
        return $body
            ->schema([
                Body\Layout\BodyColumn::make()
                    ->schema([
                        Body\Table::make()
                            ->data(
                                fn(?array $filters) => $this->registrationSummary($filters)
                            ),
                        VerticalSpace::make(),
                        Body\Table::make()
                            ->data(
                                fn(?array $filters) => $this->verificationSummary($filters)
                            ),
                    ]),
            ]);
    }


```
### Footer
The footer is the bottom section of the report, it can be used to display a title, subtitle, image and a description. It has layouts and components that behave the same as the header section.
The footer section has the `Text` and `Image` components, and the `FooterColumn` and `FooterRow` layouts.

```php showLineNumbers

    public function footer(Footer $footer): Footer
    {
        return $footer
            ->schema([
                Footer\Layout\FooterRow::make()
                    ->schema([
                        Footer\Layout\FooterColumn::make()
                            ->schema([
                                Text::make("Footer title")
                                    ->title()
                                    ->primary(),
                                Text::make("Footer subtitle")
                                    ->subtitle(),
                            ]),
                        Footer\Layout\FooterColumn::make()
                            ->schema([
                                Text::make("Generated on: " . now()->format('Y-m-d H:i:s')),
                            ])
                            ->alignRight(),
                    ]),
            ]);
    }
```

### Filter Form
The filter form is used to filter the data that is displayed in the report. The filter form uses the Filament form builder
so you can use any of the form components that are available in Filament. The form is displayed on the side of the report, and the
filter data will be available in all the tables `data()` callback. This will be explained further in the below sections.

Example of a filter form:
```php showLineNumbers

public function filterForm(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Input::make('search')
                ->placeholder('Search')
                ->autofocus()
                ->iconLeft('heroicon-o-search'),
            Select::make('status')
                ->placeholder('Status')
                ->options([
                    'active' => 'Active',
                    'inactive' => 'Inactive',
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

### A sample report
Here is a sample report that uses all the components and layouts to create a report.
<img src="/img/sample-report.png" alt="alt text" width="100%"/>
