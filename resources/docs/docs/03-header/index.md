# Header

The header is the tompmost part of the report. In the header, you can put the report title subtitle, logo and more.

:::info
More configurations will be added for the header sections, and hence the seggregation or compartmentalization of the header into a separate section. This will allow for more flexibility in the future to add things such as background images, etc.
:::

## Components
In the header, you can place the following components:
- [Text](/docs/components/text)
- [Image](/docs/components/image)
- [Vertical Space](/docs/components/vertical-space)

Or use the following layouts to arrange the components:
- [Header Row](/docs/header/header-row)
- [Header Column](/docs/header/header-column)

:::tip
If you want to ignore the header on a specific page, you can remove this method altogether, or you can leave it as is when created, where it has an empty schema.
